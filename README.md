# JSL04 Project Brief: Dynamic Task Display & Modal View

## Overview

This projects tests my ability to make code that can be manipulated one direction through the DOM (Document Object Model). There is a hidden element, a modal (dialog), that is accessible through clicking on one of the task elements. Information is fed into the modal through array data in the JS file, accessed through unique IDS and completed by assigning values where originally there was none. I struggled a lot with this project but eventually understanding value assignments helped me unlock how to make the page work, and it was incredibly satisfying. 

The dialog element, function, event listener and psuedo functions all created headaches but eventually led to a satsifying and understandable piece of working code.

### Code Structure & Maintainability

- Structure JavaScript using **modular, single-responsibility functions**.
- Use **descriptive and meaningful variable and function names** for clarity.
- Add **JSDoc comments** to major functions, describing their purpose, parameters, and return values for better documentation.

## Expected Outcome

A fully functional **dynamic task board** where tasks appear under the correct columns, and users can **open a modal to view/edit** task details. The project will follow **clean, well-documented, and maintainable code practices**, ensuring a professional and scalable implementation.
